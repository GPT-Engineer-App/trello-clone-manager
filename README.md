# trello-clone-manager

I'd like to create a clone of the Trello board. A user should be able to create new cards and move them between different columns. There should be the following columns - you can consider them as task statuses: Backlog, To-do, Doing, Ready for testing, Testing, Done, and Cancelled. 

A single column can contain vrtually unlimited number of card and if they are too many, you can use vertical scrolling.

Feel free to use dnd package from this npm https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hello-pangea/dnd to achieve needed functionality.
